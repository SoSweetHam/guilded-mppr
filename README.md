### > How to get post ID
- If you are on browser use your browser's inspector window, you can use command+option+i on mac client and ctrl+shift+i on pc client, guilded makes the post id pretty clear, like literally it's just there... just copy the number and nothing else, like in this ss it would be 53274, just enter the top most post id that you wanna delete, scroll down, enter the first spam post's id and boom if everything goes correctly, congrats! you have cleared your profile! ![ss showing where it is](assets/screenshots/faq1.png "SS")
